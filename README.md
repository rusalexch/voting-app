# Test
Create a React application that implements voting for two candidates (of your choice) with the display of the ratios of votes in a Pie Chart 

## React
**Don't** use hooks 

## Not Redux
As a centralized state repository, use **your** redux implementation, as well as some react-redux elements to connect to React Components.
> Please, don't use ```redux```

## Charts
Please use [recharts library](http://recharts.org/en-US/api/PieChart)

## Server Side Rendering
Don't forget about Server Side Rendering, you don't supposed implement SSR but your code MUST be SSR ready.

## TODO
Make a fork of this repository, finish the test and then create a Pull Request
